# Fake Review Detection System

This project aims to develop a robust fake review detection system using various machine learning models, including XGBoost, reinforcement learning, logistic regression, and support vector machines (SVM). 

## Objective
The objective of this project is to create a tool that can effectively identify fake reviews on online platforms, helping users make informed decisions and maintain the integrity of online reviews.

## Features
- Utilizes multiple machine learning models for enhanced accuracy.
- Implements XGBoost for gradient boosting, reinforcement learning for dynamic adaptation, logistic regression for binary classification, and SVM for effective separation of data points.
- Provides an intuitive interface for users to input reviews and receive feedback on their authenticity.
- Offers comprehensive documentation for easy understanding and implementation.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run the main script to initiate the fake review detection system.
4. Input the reviews you want to analyze.
5. Receive feedback on the authenticity of the reviews.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have any ideas for improving the fake review detection system or implementing additional features, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.


## Acknowledgements
